# 🪟 winExit — Go To Linux

**Say goodbye to Microsoft: Analyze your Windows system, find free and open-source alternatives, and migrate automatically to Linux.**

---

## 🧠 Project Idea (Early Stage)

`winExit` is a visionary tool designed to help users transition from Windows to Linux — without getting lost in the chaos. It analyzes installed software, devices, and services running on Windows, then creates a personalized migration strategy for a free and open-source Linux system (starting with NixOS, later supporting Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.).

This isn't just about **switching operating systems** — it's about a **complete de-Microsoft-ification** of your workflow.

## 🔍 Goals

A tool that helps users:

1. **Analyze their Windows system:**
   - Detect installed software and background services
   - Analyze autostarts and registry entries
   - Identify Microsoft telemetry and integrations
   - Optionally check for Linux hardware compatibility (e.g., printers, GPUs, Wi-Fi chips)

2. **Suggest open-source alternatives:**
   - Recommend replacements for proprietary software
   - Use a curated database and community-driven suggestions
   - Offer pre-made "profiles" for common workflows (e.g., "Office Work", "Gaming", "Content Creation")

3. **Enable a smooth migration:**
   - Generate a custom Linux install configuration (starting with NixOS)
   - Build a pre-configured ISO image
   - Optionally include dotfiles, Flatpaks, Wine/Proton setups, etc.

4. **Provide support and updates:**
   - Link to community support (Discord, Matrix)
   - Keep the alternatives database regularly updated

## 🧰 First Implementation Plan

Target platform: **NixOS (initial phase)**  
Technologies:
- Windows analysis: PowerShell script or Go-based GUI tool
- Linux side: NixOS Config Generator (possibly with Web UI)
- Software mapping: YAML/JSON database for "Windows → Linux" equivalents
- ISO build: Using Nix flakes and `nixos-generators`

## 🚧 Planned Development Stages

| Phase        | Goal                                                                   |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔍 Analyze     | Scan and list installed programs and services on Windows              |
| 🔄 Mapping     | Build a database of alternative software (e.g., LibreOffice for MS Office) |
| 🛠 Generator   | Create a NixOS configuration based on the analysis                    |
| 💿 ISO         | Generate a bootable Linux ISO with pre-installed software             |
| ⬇️ Ubuntu/Fedora | Extend support to other distros (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.)               |
